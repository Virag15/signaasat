            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>SIGNAASAT primarily operates on a performance-based model where fees are charged on successful patient conversion outcomes. This policy outlines how refunds are handled for all service types.</p>
            <h2>1. Performance-Based Services</h2>
            <p>For performance-based acquisition agreements, fees are charged only upon verified patient conversion (e.g., confirmed consultation booking or appointment attendance). As charges are tied to actual outcomes, refunds are generally not applicable unless there is a documented error in conversion tracking or attribution.</p>
            <h2>2. SaaS Platform Fees</h2>
            <p>For SIGNAASAT OS platform subscriptions, fees are billed monthly or annually in advance. Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time, effective at the end of the billing period — no partial month refunds are issued. Annual subscriptions may be eligible for a pro-rated refund within 30 days of purchase if the platform has not been substantially used.</p>
            <h2>3. Custom AI Development</h2>
            <p>For custom AI infrastructure projects governed by a Statement of Work, refund eligibility is determined by the milestone and payment schedule set out in that agreement.</p>
            <h2>4. Requesting a Refund</h2>
            <p>To request a refund, contact billing@signaasat.com with your organization name, service type, and reason for the request. We will review and respond within 5 business days.</p>
            <h2>5. Disputes</h2>
            <p>If you believe a charge was made in error, please contact us before initiating a chargeback with your payment provider. We commit to resolving billing disputes fairly and promptly.</p>
